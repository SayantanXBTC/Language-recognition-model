# Language-recognition-model
A language recognition model in which when a user types a word or a sentence which is predefined in the array used in the javascript model,it returns an output which shows which language the entered text belongs to and the place name.The website is a base model open to improvements in the number of language models defined and styling using css.
Problem statement number:9 - Identification of place names from a language sentence.
DESCRIPTION:
The code is written in HTML,using css and javascript.The CSS styling and javascript used is external.We included a background image that shows diversity in languages across the world and added it to the main background of the html file.Next,we added the title of the website as Language Recognition model and added the heading also as the same.We used tags such as div and input to link the html components to the respective javascript function.The javascript code includes getelementById which takes the input from the html page and recognises it with it's id mentioned in the html code.It stores it in a variable.Next we declared a function detectLanguage which takes the constant variable text as input.Then we declare an object languageMap which stores the various language codes commonly found in javascript[We used the codes en,es,fr,de,hi,zh].Then we declared consatnt words which splits the inputs given by the user that is splits it according to any whitespaces found int line.Then we decalred several arrays each of which includes some commonly used words in the language codes mentioned before.Then we used an if statement to check if the input given by the user matches the words present in that particular language's array of words declared.If it matches then the output shows the name of the place from where that language is from,for example:If the user types hola,it will show that the place is spain and so on.A default statement is also used which displays a message if the entered text dosen't match any of the language codes defined.
The file is open to improvement in the areas such as the number of language codes,the words in the array defined and designing.
